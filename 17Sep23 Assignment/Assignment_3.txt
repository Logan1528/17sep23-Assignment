Discuss why it's essential to createaccessible websites 
and how it benefits different user groups ?

Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and 
technologies are designed and developed so that 
people with disabilities can use them. More 
specifically, people can:

perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
contribute to the Web.

Why its essential to create accessible websites ?

Your website is often the first impression a potential 
customer may have of your business. For users with 
disabilities, the internet may be the most efficient 
way to interact with your business and the only impression 
they receive. By enhancing your website with accessibility 
features, the customer experience will be smoother and more
 enjoyable for every user who visits your site. Accommodating 
everyone's needs is essential to an inclusive experience for 
every user. An accessible website provides the ability to 
engage with web material equally as much as other users.
Accessibility has many varying aspects to it, as needs 
for all disabilities should be met to the best of the 
website's ability. Fortunately, adding in accessibility 
tools is much easier than you may think and you likely 
have the ability to enhance accessibility through your 
web platform.
