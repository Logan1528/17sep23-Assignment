4. List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML ?

* Structure and organize with headers
	
	Headers are a great resource that, when used correctly, structure
 and organize content on a webpage. This allows all users to easily navigate
 your web pages, and even improve your SEO score making it easier for you to
 generate more traffic to your site.
		
* Use colors carefully
	
	Colors can help your users easily distinguish different sets of information.
 However, color blindness and other disabilities can make it difficult for users to 
find information, call-to-action buttons, or other aspects when developers fail to 
maintain a proper contrast of colors. 

* Design forms for web accessibility

	When designing online forms, it is important to properly label text fields 
with a descriptive title so people who rely on screen readers can properly complete
 the forms. Using label tags or an ARIA property will increase the accessibility of
 your web forms.

* Use tables for tabular data
	
	When tables are used for page layout purposes, users that rely on screen 
readers can face extra difficulties in understanding the content. This is due to 
the fact that the content may be read in a way that does not match the visual 
order of the page. As an alternative, use a CSS presentation, not a table, to 
structure the layout of a web page.
